This repos contains a set of translations of abstracts of [Cochrane's systematic reviews](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/) into French. Three types of translations are available: biotranslations, post-editions of Google's translate engine (circa 2016), and post-editions from LIMSI's machine translation engine (same era).
