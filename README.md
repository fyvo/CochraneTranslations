# CochraneTranslations

This repos contains a set of translations of abstracts of Cochrane's systematic reviews https://www.cochranelibrary.com/ into French. Three types of translations are available: biotranslations, post-editions of Google's translate engine (circa 2016), and post-editions from LIMSI's machine translation engine (same era).

This corpus is fully documented in this paper:
